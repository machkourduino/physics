These are all experimental physics simulations I made exploring gravity, spring, and soft-body physics. Here are the directions for each one:
gravity.py: Point your mouse to any location and press 'f' to add a new planet
elasticity.py: Point your mouse to any location and press 'f' to add a new spring mass. Use the arrow keys to move them around. 
elasticity 2.py: Use the arrow keys to move the soft body around.
